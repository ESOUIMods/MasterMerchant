I would like to thank the ZOS Developers, Dan and Seth, and the QA Team working with them for their diligence and hard work on update 41 and sirinsidiator for LibHistorie.

- Tooltip takes about 40% less time to be generated
- Price to chat update
- Tooltup price formatting update

## ChangeLog 3.7.50

- Fix for price to chat

## ChangeLog 3.7.49

- Updated replace inventory pricing routines and restored displaying the unit price
- Updates Include previous changes

NOTE: Still researching how to refresh the inventory so you don't have to scroll prior to sorting

## ChangeLog 3.7.48

- Reverted to 3.7.44
- Removes all previous changes to altering inventory prices including showing Unit Price

## ChangeLog 3.7.47

- Minor update to replacing prices in inventory. It should behave slightly better but may affect performance.
- Updated Truncation routines and the iterate over records routines in general

## ChangeLog 3.7.46

- Restored ability to sort inventory by value when altering the inventory price

NOTE: Previously to sort the inventory or the craft bag properly you would have to scroll through the entire list. 3.7.45 inadvertently removed that functionality. While the sorting is restored it will behave the same as before. I am investigating a better way to resolve both sorting and removing the altered inventory prices.

## ChangeLog 3.7.45

- Fixed long standing issue when replacing the inventory price that the price remained after disabling the feature
- Added feature to show the unit price when replacing the inventory price

## ChangeLog 3.7.44

- Changed Green checkmark for Master Writs in the Guild Store to indicate that you know the Motif and have the mats
- Adds Yellow checkmark to Master Writs in the Guild Store if you know the Motif but don't have the mats
- Added a minimal sales interval that acts similar to the Min Item count

## ChangeLog 3.7.43

- Added condition to detect the presence of MasterWritInventoryMarker to prevent duplicating markers in the guild store for Master Writs

## ChangeLog 3.7.42

- Added icon to master writs if you meet the requirements to craft the writ. (Writ Worthy required)

## ChangeLog 3.7.41

- Fixed bug introduced in 3.7.32 that affected the cache. It would not clear properly after adding someone to the guild and account filter. Cached values would not refresh for all items only the previously viewed item.

## ChangeLog 3.7.40

- Added icon to sales rows of vendor items that are above the vendor price to make it more noticeable at a glance

## ChangeLog 3.7.39

- Both listing fee and the auction house cut are calculated when determining the profit. Previously only the auction house cut was used.
- More preparation for the winter festival. Vendor items now have a warning if they are listed above the vendor cost.  Example something listed for 300g each when the vendor will sell it for 98g. Includes recipes, ingredients, style materials, lock picks, repair kits, and potency runes.
- Added warning for a few items removed from use in the game so people don't list them for 4M or 11M thinking they are rare or some nonsense.

NOTE: When viewing the price each, the full price or the actual profit will be calculated first.

## ChangeLog 3.7.38

- Added Search Bonanza context menu option

## ChangeLog 3.7.37

user:/AddOns/MasterMerchant/AGS_Integration/SortOrderDealPercent.lua:3: attempt to index a nil value
stack traceback:
user:/AddOns/MasterMerchant/AGS_Integration/SortOrderDealPercent.lua:3: in function '(main chunk)'

- Fix for error in SortOrderDealPercent.lua for those who don't use Awesome Guild Store or AGS

## ChangeLog 3.7.36

- Slightly reduced the height and width of the UI
- Some options not available with Awesome Guild Store installed are now disabled in settings
- Added a tier of medium to the top level controls so the window is not behind other windows

## ChangeLog 3.7.31

- Updated (BETA) Winter Festival Writs to include the 3 that have a provisioning requirement.
- Refined tooltip generation and refactored its code
- Added toggle to disable the Material Cost for Winter Festival Writs (WritWorthy, LibLazyCrafting does not handle furniture)

## ChangeLog 3.7.29, 3.7.30

- Added Material Cost for Winter Festival Writs (BETA)
- Account for writ requirements. For example when you are required to craft 12 items. (Not all requirements are known at this time)

NOTE: MM currently only provides Material Cost for Winter Festival Writs. MM does not tell you if you are missing mats. (Yet) For all other writs use WritWorthy.

## ChangeLog 3.7.28

- Overhauled the MM cache so that any third party library (libPrice) or mod will receive the price directly from the cache
- The price cache is cleared on a per item basis as new sales come in which could alter the average

## ChangeLog 3.7.25, 3.7.26, 3.7.27

- Corrected issue obtaining skill and rank information on alts that have not unlocked Chef, Brewer, or Chemistry
- Corrected issue where MM was not calculating 4 extra Poisons per rank for Chemistry

## ChangeLog 3.7.24

### Concern

I wasn't going to update MM just to alter dependencies again but because of LibAlchemy and LibPrice it is still an issue for some people.

- People would update MM and not install LibAlchemy
- Some people would install LibAlchemy but not update LibPrice even if another mod such as WritWorthy requires LibPrice

### Fixes

- Updated both the MasterMerchant and LibGuildstore manifest files to add version checks for LibPrice and added both LibAlchemy and LibPrice to them to keep them from loading if libraries are not installed or updated

## ChangeLog 3.7.23

- Removed LibPrice as a dependency

NOTE: While testing I didn't have any Circular dependency. I would not have uploaded 3.7.22. Sorry for the inconvenience. It depends on the mods you have installed and active.

## ChangeLog 3.7.22

REMINDER: Until MM initializes you will not see any additional MM information on the tooltip

NEW LIBRARY: LibAlchemy

- Added Craft Cost for Potions and Poisons

NOTE: I will be updating MM and LibPrice so that LibPrice manages a cache for prices. LibPrice sort of does that now but it does not cache the price depending on the Focus used. Such as Default, SHIFT, CTRL or both. It may not really be needed since "Default" is the most common used price for the individual user regardless of how it has been customized.

## ChangeLog 3.7.21

- Update Craft Cost to use Chef and Brewer rather then just dividing by 4 by default
- Updated Craft Cost tooltip to show cost, and cost each based on Chef or Brewer

## ChangeLog 3.7.20

- Update Craft Cost for Galen recipes

## ChangeLog 3.7.19

- API bumps for all dependencies, especially LibHistoire. Make sure you update all your dependencies.

## ChangeLog 3.7.18

- Added support to display the MM tooltip for Furniture Catalogue

## ChangeLog 3.7.17

- Added export routines for personal sales and purchases. Use /mm help and documentation has been updated.

## ChangeLog 3.7.15, 3.7.16

- Updated French Translation
- Changed order of when date range tables are built to prevent an odd error
- Added a few more verifications to prevent MM routines from being used when MM is not initialized

## ChangeLog 3.7.14

- Resolved saving the position of the window depending on the selected view
- Resolved issue when viewing listings in the Trader, if the item had no sales data and you were viewing the profit, the Deal Calculator would report -1 in Green unless you chose a different rank for items with no sales. This has been removed.
- Added new time frames for viewing all guild sales. Default uses the same behavior MM has always had. Custom will use the timeframe indicated in settings.

## ChangeLog 3.7.13

- Updated currency formatting
- Added note to Custom Timeframe so you know to reload the UI if you change it
- Adjusted the X days range to use seconds from midnight prior to determining the range for consistency because all other ranges for days does the same including Today and Yesterday

The ZOS currency formatting would not handle a number higher then about 3B and would return 100,020,635 instead of 4,394,987,931. This was true for the two original ways MM has always handled currency, and another way using zo_strformat() and CURT_MONEY from the wiki. So I had to use an Lua example from the web.

## ChangeLog 3.7.12

- Forgot to add AM/PM for 12 hour time
- Forgot to add MM/DD or DD/MM date formats

## ChangeLog 3.7.11

- Updated French translation
- Added Time Format options

## ChangeLog 3.7.10

- Updated French translation

## ChangeLog 3.7.09

- Changed menu name to Deal Calculator Options for clarity

NOTE: Documentation has been updated with the new menus.

## ChangeLog 3.7.08

- Added Buy It! Deal Range to Custom Deal Calculator
- Added toggle to TTC Suggested to modify the value by 25 percent like they do in their tooltip

## ChangeLog 3.7.07

- Added Custom Deal Calculator

NOTE: A function to provide custom values for the Deal Calculator was always there but only enabled for two people. I don't know if Philgo68 or khaibit added that. A settings menu has been added and a toggle for the function to be used.

WARNING: There is no function to check if you set an incorrect value or not. Meaning if one value is 25 percent and the value above it is 20 percent then nothing will tell you that's not going to work. You will need to keep the values in line yourself.

## ChangeLog 3.7.06

- Added new constants for mod authors for upcoming API, for testing
- Corrected 7, 10, and 30 day totals from Guild Rank view
- Update to Export Sales Activity, it now uses the date range selected on the guild roster rather then the last 10 days. Should you want the last ten days, then choose that from the dropdown.

## ChangeLog 3.7.05

- Removed dependency LibDateTime

NOTE: After testing a concern that the patch caused some kind of odd timestamp issue I have confirmed it has not. The author of LibHistorie explained, "as long as the information stays on the same PC and the system clock is not modified, it is consistent with itself and you do not have to think about any conversions or whatever."

## ChangeLog 3.7.03, 3.7.04

- Update to ZOS GetGuildKioskCycleTimes() function for determining sales week
- Added new dependency LibDateTime

## ChangeLog for 3.7.02

### For Authors:

The function MasterMerchant:toolTipStats() has been removed. Use MasterMerchant:itemStats(itemLink, false) instead.

### For Users:

NOTE: The documentation is not updated so in order to update how potions and writs are sorted, you will need to use the following slash command

/lgs clean, which is /LGS CLEAN but use lowercase.

### Changes:

- Added right click options to guild store (Vanilla and AGS) to add the Seller or the Guild Name to the Guild and Account filter.
- Added voucher information for Writs to the tooltip and price to chat. The price per voucher is based on the average not the exact Writ itself. So don't whip out your calculator and tell me that x / y isn't zz.zz. It's based on the total average.
- Option to not use the price per voucher since Writ Worthy shows cost based on the craft cost of the requirement for the Writ.
- Writs are sorted by voucher count so some writs may not have any sales information when they may have previously.

### Writ Change:

After a conversation with Octopuss which didn't go well and I apologize for that, I went out looking at Writs on other traders. I mentioned I needed to rewrite the Writ system with 3.3.6 anyway.

Using Bonanza and other things I looked at prices, cost per voucher, and what you have to craft. I noticed that even though you may need Roe or Dreugh Wax to make them, the prices were all over the place. After asking about things it seemed people throw them up and if they sell quickly, price it higher the next time. I still don't like how some Writs will now have no sales data because of the amount of Vouchers but it seems the change is needed.

The other thing I noticed is that Awesome Guild Store has a price per voucher as well. The price uses the same calculation as MM such that it is the average price and voucher count. Writ Worthy has hard coded information for calculating prices for crafting the requirement for the Writ.

## ChangeLog for 3.7.01

NOTE: MM has never had a method to account for joining and leaving guilds. Meaning it never configured the many arrays needed for MM to function. I added some additional code for LibHistoire to help the library if either event occurs.

Thanks to all the GMs that let me join and leave their guilds. I probably bothered them more then they wanted. Guilds that helped were: Feline Great Meowporium, Free Marketers, Spicy Economics, Krafty Retro Designs, and the Conquest of Tamriel.

If you have any issues just make sure sales are linked as mentioned in the documentation listed on the description page and then use the Refresh LibHistoire button from the LibGuildStore settings menu.

- Added methods to account for leaving and joining a guild after you log in with LibHistoire already running. If you join a guild just open their sales tab once. Which at that point everything should be set up and ready to receive sales data from LibHistoire.

## ChangeLog for 3.7.00

- Updated feature to right click dots to add sellers to the Guild & Account filter. The High Isle update seemed to have broken it even if it was intermittent.

## ChangeLog for 3.6.99

- Reverted a portion of the routine for saving sales data faster because ranks were not being presented properly. This will probably have an impact on saving events and it will be slower again.

## ChangeLog for 3.6.98

- Update to routines for saving sales data from LibHistoire. System specifications will impact this to a degree. However, the amount of sales you retain will have the greatest impact. The data should be saved a little quicker.

## ChangeLog for 3.6.97

- Update to contextual menus for the tooltips to address an issue I thought was resolved in 3.6.82 but obviously broke again

## ChangeLog for 3.6.96

- Updated recipe data used to calculate the craft cost for PTS or upcoming High Isle chapter. Should also address a minor lack of craft cost in newer Ascending Tide recipes.

## ChangeLog for 3.6.95

- Update for Bonanza interface for internal BeamMeUp changes

## ChangeLog for 3.6.94

- Pre PTS Version

## ChangeLog for 3.6.93

- Update Truncate routines to watch for a total count of 0

## ChangeLog for 3.6.92

- Update French and fix Japanese and Portuguese strings

## ChangeLog for 3.6.91

- Bug Fix: Bonanza price was not using the Guild and Account filter names properly.
- Bug Fix: Changed incorrect notification that BeamMeUp was not installed (if it was not detected) when right clicking the location column in the Bonanza window to jump to the zone for that trader.
- Added Lock Button.
- Added 3 different price to chat formats under Master Merchant settings.
- Added right click option for Bonanza window for the seller's column so you can more easily add them to the Guild and Account filter. This functions the same as right clicking a dot on the graph.
- Omit the Bonanza price when there are less then 6 valid prices after trimming outliers. There are two separate settings. One for the graph and one for price to chat.

- Fix for linking item prices when there is no MM price for the day range being used

## ChangeLog for 3.6.79

- Adjustment to Refresh: Won't sort ranks information during refresh as thousands of records are added one at a time. If you notice issues after a Refresh with the Ranks view, reload the UI for now until 3.8.x.

## ChangeLog for 3.6.78

- Fix: Additional bypass for AddExtraListingsData() when encountering an erroneous record where the ["sales"] table is empty or doesn't exist.

## ChangeLog for 3.6.76

- Fix: Additional bypass for AddExtraSalesData() when encountering an erroneous record where the ["sales"] table is empty or doesn't exist.

## ChangeLog for 3.6.74

- Updated detailed graph points to say Today, Yesterday, or X days ago.

NOTE: You are lucky I had a brainstorm because I did not want to revert to use zo_strformat() because it is the most costly way to format the strings

## ChangeLog for 3.6.73

- Fix: Bypass for AddExtraSalesData() when encountering erroneous records. All erroneous records will first be logged then removed from the data pool / LazyPyro
- Fix: MasterMerchant_UI.lua:1229 when searching for Necklace of a Mother's Sorrow / Thrasher

- Fix: When adding buying advice and for some reason the itemLink is an empty string
- Fix: When adding buying advice and for some reason the TTC Suggested Price is nil

- Thanks to Talisman for sticking with it until the issue was resolved.

## ChangeLog for 3.6.64

- Update to prevent LWC from causing an error by accessing MM to early before it initializes

NOTE: For future reference. Future releases will not contain patches and hot-fixes for other authors mods. It is their job to ask which functions to use for the information they want. If there is no API then they should not alter MM functionality. Other authors like sirinsidiator would not alter their mod if authors were altering the mod's internal functionality or using the incorrect function. For example if an author changed AGS functionality no patches would be made. It would be discussed and if the sirinsidiator objected to the feature request then that would be the end of it.

## ChangeLog for 3.6.63

- Enhancement to trimming outliers

## ChangeLog for 3.6.62

- Added silent logging of mods using MM pricing functions for debug purposes
- Fix: Price Calculator Russian client

## ChangeLog for 3.6.61

- Hotfix: Disable all notifications for mod authors using the wrong MM functions for information. I will have to find a different approach. I apologize however, I don't know which programs use MM for data.

I intend to make improvements and when I do I can't preemptively inform authors ahead of time that there will be changes. MM is not a library like LibGPS where you might want to create an alias routine for backwards compatibility.

## ChangeLog for 3.6.60

- Behavior Change: Due to so many other mods accessing MM for pricing data I can not control how they do it or what they break. There are now notifications for popular functions if authors use them. Tell the author to contact me for how they should access MM data.
- Debug Log: There is a revised attempt to catch errors with the Bonanza price when the information is incomplete.
- While testing the Reset function for resetting Bonanza information I realized it didn't clear the scroll list. A temporary fix is in place to reload the UI when the reset is complete.

## ChangeLog for 3.6.59

- Fix: bad argument #2 to 'string.sub' (integer expected, got nil) MasterMerchant.lua:776: in function 'MasterMerchant:BonanzaPriceTip'

## ChangeLog for 3.6.58

- Hotfix: Bonanza pricing was not ignoring account names or guilds added to the Guild & Account filter

## ChangeLog for 3.6.57

- Added TTC and Bonanza to Deal Calculator. Choose from MM Avg, TTC Avg, TTC sug, Bonanza prices.

## ChangeLog for 3.6.55

- Fix for: MasterMerchant.lua:486: operator - is not supported for number - nil

## ChangeLog for 3.6.54

- Fix for: MasterMerchant.lua:555: operator / is not supported for nil / number

## ChangeLog for 3.6.53

- Added tooltip cache back as it was still a bit jerky for my taste

## ChangeLog for 3.6.52

- Updated startup routine in an attempt to prevent time out during login
- Updated tooltip generation. The tooltip is no longer cached however, I only tested with about 5100 sales on gold mats. I left some of the old code in place in case some people have insane amounts of data and it needs to be added again.

## ChangeLog for 3.6.51

- Attempt to ensure the price calculator auto fills
- Address possible issue when entering a price into the price calculator and output a message

NOTE: Tooltip calculation still needs to be looked at and why it pauses so much. Enhancements and suggestions by Shinni and others may not actually improve the graph overall, when it should.

## ChangeLog for 3.6.50

- Fix for: Error in LibGuildStore/Settings.lua:19
- ATT import notification makes it more clear that it is an MM message, and tells you where to go to import the data, and where to disable the notification

## ChangeLog for 3.6.49

- New Toggle: Save Central Pricing Data. Pricing data is the same for all guilds. When disabled, pricing is separate for each guild.
- New LibGuildStore Import: Import Pricing Data, it's more of an override or replace then an import.
- Fix issue where the blue Bonanza price would be superimposed over the yellow MM price

## ChangeLog for 3.6.48

- Update Russian translation, mychaelo
- Fix bug for Bonanza pricing when the only price is someone in the Guild & Account Filter
- When importing MM data, import data regardless of the timestamp. Allow the trimming routine to remove the sale based on user settings.

## ChangeLog for 3.5.29

- Imported changes for adjusting description text from the 3.6.x Beta used during /mm clean to change text for other unofficial translations, or official translations

## ChangeLog for 3.5.28

- Added routine to store last sale price when AGS is active. However I believe AGS does this internally.
- Added alias functions for a few depreciated functions

NOTE: The last sale price was updated because AGS is trying to access it regardless of whether or not it is there. I have been wondering why the data was not saved when AGS was active. A special callback is required. The callback is not needed for users that do not use AGS

## ChangeLog for 3.5.27

- Removed toggle for log file that was unused but prevented certain messages from being displayed with DebugLogViewer installed

## ChangeLog for 3.5.26

- Increased API requirement for LibHistoire

NOTE: LibHistoire 1.2.0 had an issue that prevented data from being stored when you joined a new guild or were a new user. This has been addressed in 1.2.1.

## ChangeLog for 3.5.25

- API Bump for MM and Blackwood
- Increased API requirement for LibHistoire

## ChangeLog for 3.5.24

- Added toggle to hide two initialization summaries. Default is set to hide.

NOTE: Because MM will not show sales in the MM window, add pricing to the inventory, allow exporting, or record any sales data from LibHistoire until it is fully initialized, there should be some kind progress indicator. The FPS drop isn't a reasonable progress indicator even though it has been that way for years.

## ChangeLog for 3.5.23

- Added additional localization strings to cover all notifications and the help menu
- Removed verbose mode since messages no longer exist from 2.x that required that

## ChangeLog for 3.5.21

- Refresh will only restore data according to the amount of days retained in settings
- Added a fix when, on rare occasions, an empty table is found that resolves an error when adding category information

## ChangeLog for 3.5.20

- Oops, API Bump for the rest of the modules for MM

## ChangeLog for 3.5.19

- API Bump only

## ChangeLog for 3.5.18

- Added new slash command "/mm redesc" which will toggle whether or not the descriptive search text is rebuilt during "/mm clean". This is to address a crash that can occur sometimes when logging in and updating multiple fields within sales records during setup. The crash is mainly due to the sometimes tremendous amount of sales stored in the data files.

## ChangeLog for 3.5.17

- Tweak to InitItemHistory when search text is not available

## ChangeLog for 3.5.16

- Reverted changes for automatically fixing improperly formatted records during initialization

NOTE: When testing with one improperly formatted record manually added to my own from another user reporting an error I had no issues. The fix properly removed the improperly formatted record and I retained all sales. When running the game in Russian with some manual changes the data loaded and mm clean properly updated the data. Reverted changes anyway in favor of making new routines.

## ChangeLog for 3.5.15

- Resolved issue with MM trying to index improperly formatted records during initialization
- Implemented routine to auto initiate "mm clean" and "mm dups" when improperly formatted records are detected. The UI will reload automatically if this occurs.

## ChangeLog for 3.5.14

- Minor update to outliers routine.

## ChangeLog for 3.5.13

- Updated outliers routine, again. Third times a charm, I hope.

NOTE: You might want to copy paste the people from your blacklist into a text document and exclude that while you look at the scatter plot or graph while trimming the outliers.

## ChangeLog for 3.5.12

- Reverted to previous method for trimming outliers.

## ChangeLog for 3.5.11

- Saved pricing data was not set up as a default variable during initialization in previous versions going back to 2.x. This has been corrected.

## ChangeLog for 3.5.10

- Minor bug fix where during initialization an error may have occurred on occasion if a personal sale was reported before MM could initialize a few of its variables.

## ChangeLog for 3.5.09

- Fixed bug where AGS profit filter setting was not kept after log in or reload UI.

## ChangeLog for 3.5.08

- Updated Initialize routine

## ChangeLog for 3.5.07

- Latest version of LibHistoire reports better values with its GetPendingEventMetrics routine. Updated Refresh routine to stop more easily.

## ChangeLog for 3.5.06

- Updated Refresh routine. Reverted some aspects of it now that LibHistoire has been updated. It was taking too long again.

## ChangeLog for 3.5.05

- Added methods to prevent (significant) FPS drop when a new sale is added while the Master Merchant window is open. This is because I am starting to see new sales show again while online.
- Updated /mm dups
- Updated /mm clean to remove invalid item links
- Added additional routines to verify invalid item links

NOTE: The focus of invalid item links in the current versions will be explained in a sticky post. Please watch the comments section's sticky post for an update with an important announcement. There will also be an additional documentation update.

## ChangeLog for 3.5.04

- Adjusted Refresh routine so it will stop after events are sent even after an upcoming change to LibHistoire.

## ChangeLog for 3.5.03

- Added more verification for malformed item links.

NOTE: I forgot something in 3.5.02, so it's not available.

## ChangeLog for 3.5.01

- Updated refresh routine to announce when refresh is finished. The spinner in the Master merchant window will also stop spinning as well.

## ChangeLog for 3.5.00

- Fixed Gamepad errors when listing items.

NOTE: Thanks to Lyelu I have a gamepad that works with ESO. I can not promise anything but I am looking into how to add some of the simple basic features to the Gamepad UI. Although I hear that since the Gamepad usage is so low, according to ZOS that some mod authors use some Gamepad aspects of the game for convenience in keyboard mods. Meaning, it breaks the Gamepad portion of the game.

## ChangeLog for 3.4.9

- Added additional search index values
- Added routine for expanding Libhistoire when using the refresh button. (Still in testing)
- Added Popup Item Data to Master Merchant window for convenience

## ChangeLog for 3.4.8

- Fixed some minor typos
- Fixed search index values. The API has changed enough that the search terms were a bit broken. Items you are searching for should show up correctly now. Such as a green or purple heavy helm.
- Added initial lookup tables for upcoming changes to Saved Vars files
- Removed old auto next feature for the guild store. It was no longer used and it's just a bad idea especially when AGS is active because at least for AGS it will break it.

## ChangeLog for 3.4.7

- Update to ShoppingList extension to prevent duplicate items. Delete your ShoppingList.lua from your SavedVariables to reset it.

## ChangeLog for 3.4.6

- Added optional MM extension, ShoppingList

NOTE: Rothry has suggested this addition and at the time it did not seem like something I would add. Mainly because I am not sure I want to know everything I purchased. However, I am in the process of learning more about the MM Window, ZOS Scroll Lists, and other more complex parts of this beast of a mod. For that reason it is packaged with the mod and can be enabled or disabled. I hope you enjoy it.

EDIT: 12-9-2020; I will be overhauling both MM and the ShoppingList. The data for MM will be preserved and kept. The data from the ShoppingList will not be preserved because I will be obtaining different sales data from traders either from AGS or the vanilla UI if you do not have AGS installed or active.

## ChangeLog for 3.4.5

- Added the remaining help icons for the settings menu

NOTE: Still working on the documentation but as I have time to complete each section it will help explain the various options.

## ChangeLog for 3.4.4

- Restored color to the deal calculator when viewing items in the guild store

NOTE: Still looking into all the challenges for localizing the currency format and colorization. Thank you for your patience.

## ChangeLog for 3.4.3

- Opps forgot other language strings for new menu options

## ChangeLog for 3.4.2

- Updated settings menu including help icons that go directly to the documentation.
- Updated LibGuildRoster setup to attempt to control the columns better until the next update to the library.

## ChangeLog for 3.4.1

- Bugfix for not stopping LibHistoire properly during Refresh

## ChangeLog for 3.4.0

- Opps forgot other language strings for key-bind

## ChangeLog for 3.3.9

- Fix for setting days of history lower then 30
- Added key-bind to toggle History Graph


## ChangeLog for 3.3.8

- Added a 3rd Focus which can be used for CTRL + SHIFT for example
- Changed the name of the Master merchant window. See documentation. Link is on the description page.- - Made sure when displaying values in the inventory that the gold color is yellow
- Made sure the custom time range updates for the drop down menu

## ChangeLog for 3.3.7

- Opps forgot to add the new data pool to the manifest file

## ChangeLog for 3.3.6

- Bugfix for blacklist
- Fix typo in setting menu
- Added toggle for guild roster columns. Requires UI reload.
- Writs with the same item ID will be grouped together now.

NOTE: Prior to having Writs the last part of the item link was for potions only. This caused MM to treat writs of the same type but a different voucher count as different. I will be adding a new system for writs in a future version.

## ChangeLog for 3.3.5

- Updated gold price label to use in game API formatting.(Meaning less numbers with a decimal of '.00' This should also add some formatting for non English users. I will be testing this more.
- Added lookup table so that if you hover over an item twice, and no sales have been added, the tooltip needs to reconstruct less information. Should make tooltips take a little less time to draw for items have have close to 5000 sales in the MM database. There isn't much I can do to improve this more. Remember too much of a good thing... you can easily see trends with less data points over the same amount of time.

## ChangeLog for 3.3.4

- Added option to select mean or median when calculation outliers.

For a range from 1 to 999 the data with the mean could give you and average of 89 and with the median 42. While other items like chromium grains, you may not see much of a difference. You could have way more data points. For example 44 compared to 3000. Therefore the chromium grains will have a much more focused range. Nobody wants to buy chromium grains for 125,000. The shear quantity of data points make chromium grains show a more meaningful trend then another item with less then 100 sales.

## ChangeLog for 3.3.3

- Added toggle to use the default range for tooltips, for inventory as well.

## ChangeLog for 3.3.2

- Significant performance improvements when adding events during Refresh.
- Added Simple Indexing - For those who do not search sales and want MM to have a smaller memory footprint.
- Reduced forced Master Merchant window lock to 10 minutes for Refresh. Again after the next LibHistoire I will be able to unlock the window automatically after LibHistoire finishes sending events to MM.

NOTE: On my Lynnfield i3 4GB Ram Potato I was able to reduce the Refresh time for a backup that was about 12 days old to under 10 minutes. Your situation may be different. Again, if you have low FPS viewing All sales then LibHistoire is still working. Close the Master Merchant window and wait longer. Hopefully Sirinsidiator will update LibHistoire soon.

## ChangeLog for 3.3.1

- Removed leftover MM 2.x code that prevented the Refresh routine from properly locking the Master Merchant window. The 20 minute lock may not be sufficient depending on how much data there is in the cache. See the sticky post.

## ChangeLog for 3.3.0

- More updates to prevent errors when calculating outliers while holding down CTRL or SHIFT

## ChangeLog for 3.2.9

- Updated mean and standard deviation calculation
- Added median value calculation for use when determining outliers
- Updated routine for determining outliers

## ChangeLog for 3.2.8

- Performance increase to checking for duplicate sales. No optimization for adding new sales unfortunately. - Added temporary `/mm freeze` and `/mm unfreeze` for Master Merchant window when processing 100,000+ sales or more
- Temporary workaround until next LibHistoire update. After clicking Refresh the Master Merchant window will be locked and will not update for 20 minutes while MM and LibHistoire communicate.

NOTE: After the next update LibHistoire will have an internal API function I can check to know when data is being transmitted to MM and lock and unlock the Master Merchant window automatically.

## ChangeLog for 3.2.7

- Added taxes to `/mm export` feature, see documentation
- Adjusted saved vars tracking var for outlier prices

## ChangeLog for 3.2.6

- Added version check for LibHistoire 1.0.2
- Removed Info/Debug messages
- Updated when MM starts LibHistoire and begins listening for information

## ChangeLog for 3.2.5

- I will rant at Siri later, debug messages are not logged by his mod by default. I have changed it to Info, so I can see the output.

## ChangeLog for 3.2.4

- Added debug messages for nil value Lua error

## ChangeLog for 3.2.3

- Attempt to address error in MasterMerchant.lua:3971: attempt to index a nil value

## ChangeLog for 3.2.2

- Opps didn't save version number properly in manifest file.

## ChangeLog for 3.2.1

- Attempt to address error in MasterMerchant.lua:3965: attempt to index a nil value
- Code added to restrict listening to guild sales. Which is an attempt to address possible performance hits.

NOTE: I don't feel MM 3.2.0 really has an effect on the game in a drastic way. If there is any pause or freeze in any way that is just because the library is sending data on first use. If you have thousands of sales, up to maybe 30,000 or more sales in a busy guild all being sent to MM at once, there will be a freeze. This should settle down after a few days if you keep the new library linked.

## ChangeLog for 3.2.0

- Now using LibHistoire for guild sales instead of scanning guild history directly.

## ChangeLog for 3.1.0

- To display information on the roster MM now uses LibGuildRoster

## ChangeLog for 3.0.9

- Fix for error generated guild finder rather then guild history

## ChangeLog for 3.0.8

- Added localization strings for new "Use Sales History Size Only" to the rest of the languages

## ChangeLog for 3.0.7

- Fix Price Calculator Bug
- Add toggle to ignore min and max count when trimming sales data

## ChangeLog for 3.0.6

- Same as 3.0.4
- More recipe updates from - Dolgubon
- Fix for Lua errors for new saved vars - Dolgubon

## ChangeLog for 3.0.5

- Reverted back to 3.0.3 until a fix for Lua errors can be implemented

## ChangeLog for 3.0.4

- Adjustment to item link trait discovery Aldanga
- Update to recipe calculations Dolgubon (Still some recipes may not show mat price)
- Added event index count to guild history tab and the amount of history loaded in hours, days. Using a built in Zenimax routine. It does not show 1d 3h, just 1 day or 2 days.

## ChangeLog for 3.0.3

- Updated event monitor so it will properly activate after zoning

## ChangeLog for 3.0.2

- Added decrement button since background scan is no longer present. It will deduct 50 from the event index, more like a rewind just a bit if you think you missed a sale.

## ChangeLog for 3.0.1

- Uncommented a few things in MM clean when checking for numbers that should not be strings

## ChangeLog for 3.0.0

- Initial changes to add an event monitor for guild history as it comes in. This is the same feature as introduced in 2.4.8.

## ChangeLog for 2.5.0

- Reverted MM to the sate of Philgo's last update 2.3.1
- Fix for MasterMerchant_Util.lua:466 to fix bug introduced in 2.3.1
- Reverted all scanning mechanics to 2.3.1
- Reverted indexing and filtering mechanics to 2.2.1
- By reverting indexing and filtering mechanics this fixes the issues with personal sales not appearing in the master merchant window
- Updated Kiosk flip times for Tuesday. Which includes the removal of tracking the 9 day week prior to the kiosk flip.

## ChangeLog for 2.4.9

- Updated /mm help
- Typecast certain variables for comparisons. Which hopefully will not allow anymore duplicate sales entries.
- Changed verbose level for Event Monitor (Now verbose 5) Default verbose is 4
- Hopefully fixed bug with MasterMerchant.lua line:2218

## ChangeLog for 2.4.8

- Simple indexing and scanning removed (introduced in 2.3.1)
- Background scan removed (See NOTE1)
- /mm missing removed (See NOTE2)
- Added guild history monitoring
- Improved duplicate checking when using /mm dups

NOTE1: During testing the requests from the server were denied 1440 times and granted 30 times over a course of 40 minutes for 3 different guilds.

NOTE2: Guild history is not sorted. Therefore you can not start at a certain place by tracking a specific time or event and scan from that point. The only viable option is to track the number of events and then avoid scanning the same events.

## ChangeLog for 2.4.7

- Left a debug message active sorry

## ChangeLog for 2.4.6

- Left a debug message active sorry

## ChangeLog for 2.4.5

- Revised Kiosk cut off time routines

## ChangeLog for 2.4.4

- Removed Philgo's Simple Indexing and Simple Scanning.

Note: At this time there are still performance issues. I will be addressing them as time permits. Removing Simple Indexing and Simple Scanning will introduce old performance issues. There isn't anything I can do about that at this time. I went with functionality over performance for now.

## ChangeLog for 2.4.3

- Fixed some typos

## ChangeLog for 2.4.2

- Revised Kiosk cut off time routines

NOTE: Needs testing for EU

## ChangeLog for 2.4.1

- Oops missed a few debug message thresholds

## ChangeLog for 2.4.0

- Time between scans 5 minutes minimum now because data is provided by the server without requesting it.
- Time between requests for data 30 seconds because the server already gives you data about once a minute.

NOTE: After more testing with my new cache library there is no reason to send frequent requests to the server for more data because the request is denied. Data is already provided about every minute. My cache library shows that with that kind of interval, 2 to 3 minutes you would be caught up as far as sales for your guild. After that you would just receive data you already have plus any new sales. This includes being logged out for 5 hours.

## ChangeLog for 2.3.9

- Removed some of the additional delays.

## ChangeLog for 2.3.8

- Added debug framework for odd reported errors

## ChangeLog for 2.3.7

- First adjustment for 9 day week, then regular 7 day weeks.
- More updates as information is confirmed.

## ChangeLog for 2.3.6

- Adjusted position of UI element 'Hide Offline' when viewing guild sales from guild roster

## ChangeLog for 2.3.5

- Adjusted routine to account for when the guild store is offline and we are waiting for Zenimax to resolve the issue

## ChangeLog for 2.3.4

- Use Zenimax API function GetGuildKioskCycleTimes() instead of previous method

## ChangeLog for 2.3.3

- Removed left over debug routines for mouse over controls when verbose was set to 5

## ChangeLog for 2.3.2

- Fix for MasterMerchant_Util.lua:466
- More refactoring for how Libraries load

## ChangeLog for 2.3.1

- Switched Guild cut-over time.
- Added new recipes for Craft Cost calculations.
- Added 'Simple Guild History Scanning' setting which makes guild scanning much simpler, but may leave gaps in your historical data.
- Added 'Minimal Indexing' setting option to conserve memory at the expense of search flexibility and speed in the MM window.
- Reworked Libraries

## ChangeLog for 2.2.1

Turbo Mode removed at ZOS's request.

## ChangeLog for 2.2.0

Turbo Mode
-  '/mm turbo' will toggle Guild Scanning Turbo Mode on/off.
-  Please use Turbo mode sparingly, think of the poor servers!
-  Turbo mode is not available from 1 hour before trader flip until 1 hour after trader flip.
-  Turbo mode status is NOT remembered across reloads/logins and must be manually activated.
-  When you join a new guild, MM scans back only 3 days to get you started. You can manually load more with the '/mm missing' command.
-  Added new recipes to Craft Cost calculations.
-  Please visit tinyurl.com/MMIssueGuide if you are having any issues with MM.
-  '/mm help' gives some details on MM options and functions.

## ChangeLog for 1.7.1d
